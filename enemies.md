## Bosses

Find information about individual bosses in [the
wiki](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Bosses_in_Cadence_of_Hyrule#Bosses).

The [Instrument dungeon](./dungeons.md#instrument-dungeons) bosses
have two variants: a standard variant, and a more powerful variant
(nicknamed bossname 2 by the community).

- The first two you beat are the standard variant, the last two are
  the second variant
- In permadeath mode, all the bosses are the second variant instead

### Flawless boss battles

A boss battle is _flawless_ if the boss is beaten without missing a
beat or taking damage.

A flawless battle is rewarded with a choice between:

- 5 Diamonds
- A blue chest, containing a random [weapon](./weapons.md) (base
  weapon, if you don't have it yet; or glass if you do)
- A red chest with a random accessory (shovel, torch, ring, or boots)
  (can it have money too??)
