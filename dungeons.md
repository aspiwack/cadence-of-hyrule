Dungeons
========

## Kakariko crypt

- Single floor
- Miniboss is Shadow Link or Shadow Zelda (in Story Mode, it will be
  Link if you are playing as Zelda or Zelda if you are playing as
  Link).
- In story mode the miniboss drops the Hibiscus Potion

## Instrument dungeons

Each of the instrument dungeon is structured as follows: it has two
floors.

- Beating floor 1 unlocks floor 2 (but there are many ways to skip
  floor 1, as documented in [the strat
  spreadsheet][strat-spreadsheet])
- Beating floor 2 gives access to the Boss Key
- The Boss Key unlocks the door to the boss (see also the [enemy
  sheet](./enemies.md#bosses))

Floors structure:

- Each floor has a merchant
  - Floor 1's merchant has a heart piece and two random items
  - Floor 2's merchant has a key and two random items
- Each floor has a blue chest containing either the map or the compass
  of the dungeon
  - The map reveals the entire layout of the dungeon
  - The compass adds an arrow on screen pointing to the dungeon exit
- Each floor has an enemy room with a monster head drawn on the
  entrance floor (but _not_ surrounded by railings, the railing room
  is the miniboss's, see infra). Clearing this room drops a key.
- Floor 2 has a locked chest requiring a key to unlock.
- Each floor's exit is guarded by a miniboss, in a room surrounded by
  railing, with a monster head drawn on the entrance floor.
